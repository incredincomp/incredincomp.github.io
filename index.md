[Greprow](https://github.com/incredincomp/greprow)
GrepRow is just some junk I did for a class in college. I am probably going to make it into a script to help me with webtesting, but that won't be until version 4 probably. Keep an eye on it though as I keep getting happier and happier with it. Check the page for info.

[Peep-Admin](https://www.github.com/incredincomp/peep-admin)
This is a powershell script that I spent a lot of time on (learning powershell at the same time,) that I havent gotten to test yet, but it should do some fancy stuff regarding domain events and notifying admins of said events. I don't know, it's probably a dumpster fire. Let me know :)
